# Python Naming Conventions
# Python uses snake case - every new word in the variable name is separated by an underscore
# cannot have spaces in variable names

name = "Ryan" #assigning a variable to a string
# string anything in double or single quotes

# snake case when more than one word is being used
my_dog = "Eyo"

# creating a user_name
user_name = "Johnny"

# snake case for function names
def add_nums():
    pass

# Pascal Case for class names
class ParkingGarage:
    pass

# UPPER CASE snake_case for constant variables
BE_CORE_WEEKS = 4 #constant variable is something that is not likely to change

# DONT USE CAMEL CASE - javascript uses camel case
myVar = "something"

# other naming convention conventions
# make sure our names make sense
name = 5 # that doesnt make sense
number = "Lando" # this also doesnt make sense
# DO THIS
name = "Lando"
number = 5

# code comment, # make lines invisible to the interpreter
# ctrl + / to comment and uncomment code

# INDENTATION
# indetantion is how define blocks of code
if 5 > 2: #first block 
    # nested, second block
    print("Five is greater than two") #indenting is one tab or 4 spaces
# blocks of code all the way to the left
# will always new and separate blocks from the previous lines
if 2 < 5:
    print("two is less than five")

# printing in python
# printing lets us send information to our terminal
print()
print("hello", "goodbye", 1, 2, 3)
print("hello", "1", "2.5")

my_name = "Ryan"
print(my_name)
print("hello", end=" ")
print("goodbye")

# Indentation Conutinue
# be careful with indentation errors
# while having a single space will let your code run
# we want to make sure we're tabbing or using 4 spaces so our code is readable
if 5 > 2:
 print("That is true")
    

if 2 < 5:
  print("this is also true")

# DONT DO THIS - indentation error
# if 5 > 2:
#   print("That is true")
#     print("hello")
    
# if True:
# print("Please indent me!")
# This gives an indentation error - the block below a colong must be indented

# highlight and tab to tab several lines of code
# highlight and shift tab to back space several lines of code
